## Summary
The Mata Wang is a currency exchange web application that simplifies the process of converting currencies. Built using EJS, CSS, and JavaScript, it retrieves real-time exchange rates through the @everapi/currencyapi-js. With its user-friendly interface and swift results, Mata Wang assists users in exchanging currencies seamlessly. In the future, I aim to enhance its functionality by introducing features such as user authentication, interactive charts, and language support.
