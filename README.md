## Summary
Mata Wang is a currency exchange web application that simplifies currency conversion. It utilises EJS, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch real-time exchange rates via `@everapi/currencyapi-js`. Inspired by its Malay name, which means "currency," the application focuses on providing users with a simplified and effective solution for currency exchange. I aim to enhance its functionality by introducing features such as user authentication, interactive charts, and language support.
